# UnigeMasters
A github repository to store projects from my Masters courses and research at UNIGE

Stellar Distortions: Research project with Prof. Vincent Bourrier and Dr. Adrien Deline
- Goal: Update ANTARESS to consider surface radial velocity curves of oblate spheroids with tidal bulging. Update ANTARESS to consider gravity darkening effects due to tidal bulging

Disc Truncation: Research project with Prof. Julia Venturini and Arianna Nigioni
- Goal: Model circumstellar disk truncation for circumprimary and circumsecondary disks. See how planet Embryos evolve in circumprimary disks when varying parameters

Astrophysics and Data Analysis: Contains notebooks with core statistical and data analysis techniques
    - Project A3: Creating a Random Forest Algorithm from scratch 
    - Project B2: Creating a Markov Chain Monte Carlo from scratch


Create environment using masterfall.yml
